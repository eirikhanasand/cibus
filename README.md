# Cibus
## INFT2508 Semester project

### Project description
Cibus is a food marketplace where sellers can list, and buyers can buy items. 
The focus of the app is on the display of the items, therefore "buying" items 
will just be approved without any logic except a success or error message.

### Features
- List items
- Buy items
- Sell items
- Locate items (map)
- Support for Norwegian and English
- Cart for items

### Design decisions and main components
